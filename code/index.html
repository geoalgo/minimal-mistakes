<h3>
	Gudhi's library : Skeleton-blockers simplicial complex data-structure and simplification
</h3>
	<div>
	These two packages are based on a 2011 SoCG paper. One implements a light data-structure to represent simplicial complexes of arbitrary dimension. The other proposes an efficient code for simplification operators such as edge collapse (in the 3D case, it is around 65% times faster for simplifying random two dimensional spheres with n points than CGAL).

<h3>
	Gudhi's library : User interface
</h3>

	<div>
	This package is a user interface that illustrates some of the Gudhi's functionnalities. You can load point clouds, build simplicial complexes, simplify them and so on.

		10000 points in R^9 (e.g. rotational matrices) that samples regularly SO(3).
		They are projected into R^3 for vizualization. Note that there projection is a sphere in R^3.

	<td>
		Rips complex built uppon these points. It has over 230 millions of simplices and the dimension of the mesh is 12.
	</td>
	<td>
		Complex obtained after homotopy-preserving simplification (took 2 second on 2.5Ghz single core). It has only 16 vertices and very few simplices. Computing topological invariant such as betti numbers of homology group is then very fast.

	Settlers of Catan
</h3>

	<div>
	This is an implementation of the board game settlers of catan. This is more a proof of concept, other implementations are publicly available as well.
